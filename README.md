# deploy

This project houses deployment configuration and tooling that allow us
to replicably run code in production without any guesswork.

Eventually, this may or may not contain:

- A suite of shell scripts for use in day-to-day maintenance operations
- Ansible rules for production servers
- Runtime configurations for some of our production clusters
